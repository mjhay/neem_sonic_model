This repo has Python 2.7 code for the anisotropic ice sonic velocity model.

Python package dependencies:
tensorflow
numpy
scipy
matplotlib

Example usage with synthetic data is in 'synth_sess.py'. This repository contains synthetic velocity and eigenvalue data in the corresponding CSV files. Example plot output of inferred fabric eigenvalues with depth is given by 'eigenvalues.pdf'.

Required input data:
Thin-section eigenvalues (n_ts x 3 matrix)
Thin-section depth (n_tsx1 matrix, not vector)
Observed p-wave velocities (n_vel x 1 matrix) or observed P,Sv,S (n_vel x 3 matrix)
Velocity depths (n_vel x 1 matrix)

The model is fit by first finding a smooth fit to thin section eigenvalues using Gaussian process regression. Then, velocities are modeled to the smooth fit. A smooth estimate of velocity mismatch between measured and modeled (from the thin sections) P-wave data is then found, and used to produce corrected velocities under the assumption that the eigenvalue-derived velocities are unbiased. The remaining mismatch is then regressed out by inverting the velocity model to produce corrected eigenvalues.
